# BackEndChallenge
My submission for the **Summer 2021 Shopify Developer Intern Challenge**

I chose to go with Java and Swing for this challenge, both of which I was very familiar with through school work and personal projects. 

When the application is run, a frame should appear, where the user can select the photos they would like to upload for viewing, in a scrollable gallery panel. When an image is selected, or double clicked, it will be made available for viewing in full screen. The user can upload as many batches of photos as he/she wants.

While not having the prettiest UI, my intent here was moreso to demonstrate my knowledge of *design patters*, by implementing an event based Model View Controller software architecture. I made sure to decouple each class as much as I could from one another to show the idea that this program would be highly maintainable, and easy to add more features.

If I had more time to attempt this challenge (I only saw the posting a few days ago), I would have considered doing a NodeJS web server running on an AWS EC2 instance, using S3 for media storage.
